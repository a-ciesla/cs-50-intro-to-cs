# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

My personal solutions to Harvard University's [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) problem sets and projects. This repository is intended as a portfolio of my progress throughout the course.

Note: Please do not copy these solutions directly for your own submissions. For reference and personal use only.

## Structure

### pset_0/

- `project.sb3` – a simple **"catch the apple"** game created in Scratch, inspired by the classic Polish cartoon ["Porwanie Baltazara Gąbki"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abduction_of_Balthazar_Sponge_(TV_series))

### pset_1/
