# The Abduction of Balthazar Sponge

This is a simple **"catch the apple"** game created in Scratch.  
The game was inspired by the classic Polish cartoon ["Porwanie Baltazara Gąbki"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abduction_of_Balthazar_Sponge_(TV_series)) and was converted into a playable HTML version using [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/).
